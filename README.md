Please let us know if Cheetah 5.0 misbehaves in any way. 
If the issue happens even on Vanilla Marlin, please also let the Marlin Dev team know by submitting an issue on the correct Github so we can fix the root of the issue!

## Built on Marlin 2.0

Cheetah 5.0 is proudly built on Marlin 2.0. Marlin 1.X was good. Marlin 2.0 really takes the cake. The popular RepRap firmware has gone to the next level by adding support for much faster 32-bit and ARM-based boards while improving support for 8-bit AVR boards in version 2.0. Read about Marlin's decision to use a "Hardware Abstraction Layer" below.

Download earlier versions of Marlin on the [Releases page](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/releases).

## Building Marlin 2.0

To build Marlin 2.0 you'll need [[PlatformIO](http://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/ide.html#platformio-ide). Detailed build and install instructions are posted at:

  - [Installing Marlin (VSCode)](http://marlinfw.org/docs/basics/install_platformio_vscode.html).

## License

Cheetah 5.0, brought to you by KAY3D labs is proudly built on top of Marlin 2.0. It is published under the [GPL license](/LICENSE) because we believe in open development. The GPL comes with both rights and obligations. Whether you use Cheetah 5.0 as the driver for your open or closed-source product, you must keep the Marlin open and you must provide your compatible Marlin source code to end users upon request. The most straightforward way to comply with the Marlin license is to make a fork of Marlin on Github, perform your modifications, and direct users to your modified fork.

While we can't prevent the use of this code in products (3D printers, CNC, etc.) that are closed source or crippled by a patent, we would prefer that you choose another firmware or, better yet, make your own.
